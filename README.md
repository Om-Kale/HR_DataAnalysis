# HR Data Analysis - Power BI Project

## Overview

This project involves creating an HR Data Analysis Dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard provides insights into key HR metrics such as employee turnover, performance, demographics, and more. The goal is to help HR managers make informed decisions to improve employee satisfaction and organizational efficiency.

## Problem Faced

### 1. **Inconsistent Data Quality**
   - **Problem**: The initial HR data had inconsistencies such as missing values, duplicate records, and varying formats.
   - **Solution**: I used Excel to clean the data by removing duplicates, filling in missing values where possible, and standardizing the data formats before importing it into Power BI.

### 2. **Complex Data Relationships**
   - **Problem**: The data had multiple relationships (e.g., between departments, employees, and performance metrics), making it challenging to create a coherent model.
   - **Solution**: I carefully designed the data model in Power BI, establishing the correct relationships between tables and using DAX functions to create calculated columns and measures for accurate analysis.

### 3. **Slow Dashboard Performance**
   - **Problem**: The dashboard was initially slow to load due to the large dataset and complex calculations.
   - **Solution**: I optimized the data model by reducing the data granularity, indexing columns, and using Power BIâ€™s performance analyzer to identify and resolve bottlenecks.

## Tools Used

- **Power BI**: For data modeling, analysis, and dashboard creation.
- **Excel**: For initial data cleaning and preparation.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For creating calculated fields and measures in Power BI.
